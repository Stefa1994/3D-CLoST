# 3D_CLoST (3D Convolution LSTM on Spatio-Temporal)

## General Information

3D-CLoST is a space-time flow prediction framework that exploits the synergy between 3D convolution and long-short-time memory networks (LSTM) to jointly learn the characteristics of space-time correlation from low to high levels.

## Installation

Requirements:
* Python >= 3.6
* Keras version 2.4.3
* Tersorflow version 2.3.0
